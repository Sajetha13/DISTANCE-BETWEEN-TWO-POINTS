# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Define two points in 2-dimensional space.
### Step 2: 
Obtain the coordinates of the two points.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
 Calculate the differences between the x and y coordinates of the two points.
### Step 5: 
Calculate the distance using the distance formula.

### PROGRAM:
  ```
point1= [4,2]
point2 =[10,6]

x_dif = point2[0]-point1[0]
y_dif = point2[1]-point1[1]

d=round(((x_dif**2) + (y_dif**2))**0.5, 2)
print(d)
```
